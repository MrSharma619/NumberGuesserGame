# NumberGuesserGame
  
This number guessing game is a project built on Java where the player has to guess a number given in between a range. If the guessed number is right, the player wins else, loses. It also has the concept of limited attempts (10) where the player has to guess the number within the limited attempts given. 
  
Abstract: There are 2 modes: Novice and Expert. The command line has an input value option where the player has to enter the guessed value. After completing the limits given, if the guessed number is right, the player wins else loses. The range between the number can be from 1 to 100 (Novice) or 1 to 1000(Expert). Also, if the number you’ve guessed is high or low to the actual value, the application sends you an alert “Too High” or “Too Low”. After the limited attempt is completed, the actual value is revealed.
